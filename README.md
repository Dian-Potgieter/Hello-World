# Hello-World
My first repository

I am just an Average person who wants to start learning how to program so that i can earn enough money to not starve to death, not freeze my ass off, not die of dehidration, not die of lonelyness or sleep on the floor.
I wil strive to learn all that i can and become a decent programmer who will be able to pay rent and stay alive

It's your boii
